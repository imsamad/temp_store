Link is used in doing client-side route transition b/w pages , similiar in SPA.
Any Link in the veiwport (initially or later by scroll) will be pre-fetched using SSG,
but data corresporoutesnd to SSR  will not be pre-fetched

Catch -ALL [...all]
- /slug => 404    
Optional Catch -ALL [...all] 
- /slug => result in slug and router.query==={}


Shallow Routing:-
Allow to change URL witthout running getStaticProps ,getServerSideProps or getInitialProps
U will recievce updated pathname ,query on router object

router.psh(url,null,{shallow:true})

Page route state updated not page wont get replaced

It works only for same page URL.
