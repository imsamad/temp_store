============ 1(34) ============
It is responsible for moving frames from one node to another node.
Services:-
Framing
Physical Addressing
Error ctrl
Flow ctrl
Access ctrl
Framing:- Pack bits into frames so that each frame is 
    distinguishable from other frame.
Physical Addressing:- Encapsulating header plus trailer info with packet.
Flow Control:-
    Speed Matching Mechanism
    Cordinates amount of data can be sent before recieving ack.
Access Control :- Media access ctrl
Error Control:- 
    a.) Error Detection
    b.) Error Correction
============ 2(35) ============
SubLayers
Total Five responsiblity:-(Flow)+(4 by MAC sublayer)

LLC/DLC(Logical Link Control)/(Data Link Control) sublayer
    Flow Control:- Add control info to incoming data to help to deliver to destination. 
MAC sublayer:-
    Implemented by Hardware, typically in NIC.
    Two responsiblity:-
     - Data Encapsulation
        - Frame asemble b4 transmission ,frame disassembly b4 reception of a frame.
        - Add a header & trailer to network PDU(packet)   
Functionality:-
a.) Framing
b.) Physical Addressing or MAC Addressing
c.) Error Control
d.)Media Access

Frame= Header + NetworkPDU(Packet) +Trailer
In Packet Switch network, the block of data called frame are excahnged b/w nodes not bit's streams.
This result in a sequence of bit being sent over link.

Types of framing:-
1.) Fixed Size Framing
Frame Length act as delimiter of frame, does not require additional boundary bits to identify the start and end of frame. 

2.) Variable-Size Framing
Additional mechanism are kept to mark the beginning & end of frame.
============ 5(38) ============
Framing Approaches :- 1.) Bit-oriented 2.)Byte-Oriented Approach
1.) Bit-oriented 
Frames is simply views as a collection of bits.
Data is transmitted as sequence of bits that can be interperated as text or as multimedia data.
PROTOCOLS
    HDLC <=> High-Level Data Link Control

2.)Byte-Oriented Approach
Here each frame is viewd as collection of bytes rather then bits.
a.k.a Character Oriented Approach
PROTOCOLS
    BISYNC <=> Binary Synchronous Communication Protocol
    DDCMP <=> Digital Data Communication Message Protocol
    PPP <=> Point-toPoint Protocol

============ 6(39) HDLC ============
Bit-Oriented Protocol
    HDLC 
    BegSeq+Header+Body+CRC+EndSeq === (8+16+var+16+8)
    BegSeq === EndSeq <==> 01111110
    This seq is also transmitted at any time,that the link is idle so that sender & reciever 
    can keep their clocks synchronised.
    Header => Address & Control Field

Types of HDLC frame:-
a.)I-Frame(Information Frame) 1st bit is 0.
b.)S-Frame(Supervisory Frame) 1st bit is 10.
c.)U-Frame(Un-numbered Frame) 1st bit is 11.


============ 7(40) ============
Bit-Stuffing
01111110 =>Insert extra zero after five consecutive 1 occured in non-header/trailer part.

============ 8(41) BISYNC ============
Byte-Oriented Approach
    - See frame as collection of bytes.

BISYNC === SYNC(8)+SYNC(8)+SOH(8)+HEADER+STX(8)+BODY(var)+ETX(8)+CRC(16)

SYNC:-Beg of frame is denoted by sending a special SYN.
Data portion is contained b/w special sentinal character STX and ETX.
STX :- start of text
ETX :- end of text
SOH :- Start of header.
DLE :- Data Link Escape 
CRC :- Cyclic Redundancy Check


Byte-Stuffing:- Adding one extra byte whenever there is a flag or escape character in the text.
============ 9(42) P2P ============
PPP = Point-To-Point
Data Link layer protocol.
It is WAN protocol & which is commonly run over Internet links.
Used in broadband communications having heavy loads & high sppeds.
Used to transmit multiprotocol data b/w two directly connected (P2P) computers.

Frame-Format
Flag(8)+Address(8)+Control(8)+Protocol(16)+Payload+Checksum(16)+Flag(8)
Flag:- Mark the beg & end of frame.
Address:- Set to 11111111 in case of broadcast.
Control:- Set to constant value 11000000.
Protocol:- 1/2 bytes ,defined type of data contained in the payload field.
PayLoad :- Carries data from Network Layer.
    Max Length is 1500 bytes.
    However this may be negotiated b/w endpoints of communcatio.

Character Stuffing :- Adding one xtra byte whenever there is a flag sequence appear in the payload. 

============ 10(43) DDCMP  ============
Count Field in the frame format.
Count:- How many bytes are contained in the frame body?
FrameFormat:-
SYNC(8)+SYNC(8)+Class(8)+Count(14)+Header(42)+Body+CRC(16)

If count field corrupted , then the end of frame would not be detected by the reciever.

============ 11 (44)(Error) ============
Type of Errors
1.)Single-Bit 2.)Multiple-Bit Error 3.)Burst-Error

Error Control Mechanism
 *) Error Detection
 *) Error Correction

Error Detection
Process of detecting error in recieved message withour having an original copy of 
recieved message.
1.) Vertical RC <=> Parity
2.) Logitudinal RC <=> Rows-Cols 
1.) Checksum RC <=> Divide in 'k' segment having 'n' bits,add them if carry add that too =>do 1's compelement <===> on reciever side sum of segments + checksum will give all 111111....
1.) Cyclic RC <=> Divisor,plus append L(divisor)-1 to data.


============ 12(51) Network Performance ============
It is measured in the following ways:-
a.) Bandwidth
b.) Throughput
c.) Latency(Delay)

Bandwidth vs Throughput 
1000 cars can be pass through a road per second.
Actually 100 cars are being 


a.) Bandwidth
Informal :- Maximum amount of data that can be transmitted per second.
Formal :- Number of bits that can be transmitted over network in a certain perios of time.

b.)Throughput
Informal :- Actual amount of data that passes through a network.
Formal :- How fast we can actualy sent data through a network. 

Why???
Bandwidth might be 100gbps,but end devices only handle 1gbps.


Latency:-
It defined how long a message takesto arrive at destination since the time first bit was 
sent from sender/source.

It is made up of four:-
1.) Transmission Delay
2.) Propagation Delay
3.) Queuing Delay
4.) Processing Delay
Latency = 1+2+3+4
============ 13(53) ============
1.) Transmission Delay:- How much it takes to place entire message on medium.
TD=Message Size/Bandwidth
2.) Propagation Delay :- Time takes by a bit to travel from surce to destination. 
PD=Distance/PropagationSpeed
