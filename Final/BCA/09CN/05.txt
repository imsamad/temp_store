-  Flush Timer : Controll the time b/w the route is invalidated or mark 
                as unreachable and removal of entry from table.
                Default value 240secc.
-  Hold-Down timer : Started per route entry, when hop count is change from lower to higher.
this allow the route to stabilise.                
During this time no update can be done to that entry.

THE RIP HOP COUNT : The no. of routers need to be passed to reach destination IP.
Acc. to RIP 16 Hop-Count means IP/route is unreachable as RIP hop limit.
0 Hop-Count means Route is directly connected.

LIMITATION OF RIP :- 
Hop-Count can't exceed 15.
Has slow convergence time(Knowing about all the router in network is Convergence & time to update 
            all the table in the network called CT)
Vurneable to count-to-infinity problem.  
Does not support VLSM(Variable lengh subnet masks) by RIPv1.

17.RIP versions
RIP defined two msgs:-
Request Message : It ask neighbour RIP-enabled interfaces of (router) to send its routing table.
Response Message : Carries its routing-table.


RIPv1:- Every 30 seconds RIP-enable-interfaces exchange their own routing-table.
Use classful routing, so not support subnet (VLSM).
Impossible to have different-sized subnets inside of the same network class.
No support for router authentication ,making RIP vurnerable to various attack.


RIPv2 
Support CIDR(Classless Inter-Domain Routing) as it carry subnet info.
To avoid unneccassary load on host that do not participate in routing
,RIPv2 multicast the routing-table to al adjacent routers at all address
224.0.0.9 , as opposed to RIPv1 which uses broadcast.
In RIPv2 ,md5 authentication was introduced.
Route tags also used in RIPv2 ,allows routers to distinguished b/w the router-table the router 
learned from RIP-protocol or from other protocol.

RIPng
Extension of RIPv2 ,to support IPv6.
IPv6 originally use IPsec.
RIPng sends updates on UDP port 521 using the multicast group FF02::9.
