CN :- Set of Nodes connected by communication links.
Node :- Device capable of sending /recieving data.

============ 2 ============
Characteristics (FSQS)
1.) Fault Tolerence
    - despite failure of one node, network must be operating. 
2.) Scalability
    - grow based on need, with good performance.
3.) QoS
    - Set priorities
    - Manage data traffic.
4.) Security
    - prevent(UMF)
        - unauthorised access
        - misuse
        - Forgery
    - provide(CIA)
        - confidentiality
        - Integrity
        - Availability
============ 3 ============
All Communication schema have common :- 
1.) Sender 2.)Reciever 3.)Medium
PROTOCOLS :- Set of rules governs all methods of communication.
    It defines:- 
    - What is communicated.
    - How it is communicated.
    - When it is communicated.
Protocols in human communication
    - Sender Reciever
    - common grammer
    - spped & timing
    - confirmation or acknowledgement.
--------------------------------------
Protocols defined:-
    - Message encoding.
        - Converting data to analog/digital signal.
    - Message formatting and encapsulation.
        - Agreed format b/w sender & reciever.
        - Encapsulate data with source & reciever rightly.
    - Message timing.
        - Flow control.
        - Response timing.
    - Message size.
    - Message delivery options.
        - Unicast
        - Multicast
        - Broadcast

New Trends
BYOD(Bring ur own device).
Online collaboration.
Cloud computing.(On demand availability of computer resources w/o direct active management by 
    user)

IP address
    Node in computer network identified by IP address.
    Logical address.
    Can change based on location.
    Assigned manually or dynamically.
    Represnted in decimal and have four octets(8-bit/1 Byte).
    Total 16 bits
0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
============ 10 ============
MAC address (Media Access Control)
Every node is identified by MAC add in LAN.
By manufacturer=>Physical/Hardware=>Unique=>Immutable
Represnted in Haxa-Decimal.
48 bits.
Seprator:- (-),(.),(:)
============ 11 ============
PORT ADDRESS
Process in a node is identified by PORT address.
Data which are recieved/sent must reach the right process.
PORT = Communication Port
Fixed Port No. & Dynamic Port No.(0-65535)
============ 12 ============
Switching
Help in deciding best route in data transmission if there are multiple routes.
1.)Circuit 
    - B4 data transfer a dedicated path is established b/w sender & reciever.    
2.)Message 
    - Store & forward mechanism.
    - Message is transfered as complete unit and forwarded using store and forward mechanism 
      at intermediary node.
    - Not suited for streamng media and real-time app.
3.)Packet
    - Internet is packet Switch Network.
    - Data is broken down into individual chunks called packets.
    - Each packet have source and destination address with sequence no.
    - Sequence no. help in 
     - reordering
     - detect missing packet
     - send ack.
    a.)Datagram Approach
     - connectnless switching
     - Path is not fixed, intermediary node takes decision to forward.   
    b.)Virtual Circuit Approach.
    - connection-oriented switching   
    - preplaned route is established b4 msg is sent.
    - Call request and call accept are used to establish the connection b4 transfer.
    - Path is fixed for duration of logical connection. 
============ 13 ============
Layering
Decompose problem into more manageable components.
Advantage:-
Provide more modular design.
Easy to troubleshoot.

Layered Architecture
OSI refernce model.
    Open-System Interconnection
    Model for designing a computer network that is scalable,flexible and robust inter-operable(window-buntu).
    It is guideline not Protocols thats why,model 
    Developed by ISO(International Standard of Organisation).
    It show how to facilitate communication bw different systems w/o requiring changes 
     to logic of underlying hardware and software.
    It is never fully implemented.
TCP/IP model.
    It is hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, each of which provide a 
    specific functionality.
