Process:- Program in execution.
Thread :- Unit of execution within a process.
    A process can have anywhere from one thread to many thread.


=============== 2(17) ===============
Process State:-
As process execute ,it change its states.
State of process is defined in part by the current activity of that process.
NEW
RUNNING
WAITING
READY
TERMINATED
=============== 3(18) ===============
PCB (Process Control Block)
Each process is represented by PCB in OS.
Process ID
Process State
Process Number
Process Counter
Registers
Memory Limits
List of open files
=============== 4(19) ===============
Objective of multiprogramming is to have some process running at all times ,to maximise CPU utilisation.
Objective of time-sharig is to switch CPU among process so frequently that user can interact witheach program smoothly while it(they) is(are) running.
VLC player ,VS code,File Manager

Scheduling Queues:-
Job Queue:- As process eneter the system they are put into job queue
Ready Queue :- Process which are in main memory and are ready & waiting to execute are kept in list called ready queue. 
=============== 5(20) ===============
Context Switching
On interupt OS save the context of currently running process on CPU, so that OS can restore
that context when the procesing is done,essentially suspending the process and then resuming it.
That ctx is represented in PCB of the process.

Context-Siwtch Time is pure overhead.
It speed varies machine-to-machine,
Depend on memory speed,no of registers to copied & existence of special instructions.

=============== 7(22) ===============
Process Termination
A Process Terminates when it finsh executing its last statement
,ask OS to delete it by calling exit() system call.
All the resource de-allocated by OS corresponds to that process.

Parent may trigger termination of its children bcoz of :- 
child exceeded usage of some resources that it has allocated.
Task assigned to child no longer required.
Parent is exiting & OS does not allow child process if their parent does no more exist/terminates.
Parent process can cause termination of child processes
