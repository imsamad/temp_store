Thread :- It consists of 
a.) Thread ID
b.) Program Counter
c.) Register Set
d.) Stack

Thread belons to same process ,share among each other their 
code-setion,data-section & OS resources e.g. open files & signals.

Thread have their own Register+Stack.

MultiThreadProcess=(t1+t2+t3+...)+(Code+Data+Files) ==> Common

Benefits:-
1)Responsiveness:-
Interactive app can allow a propg to continue running in case some other 
portion is doing block blocking /lengthy operation. 
2.) Resource Sharing :- Threads share process properties code, data,memory.
3.) Economy :- 
    => Altogether process creation need allocating memory & resources,bcoz thread share resources of process they belong.
    => It is more economical to create & context-switch thread.
4.) Utilization of MultiThreadProcess:-
    => Thread in MultiThreadProcess architecture run in parallel on diff processor,
        which increase benefit manifold, & increase concurrency.

=============== 2(32) ===============
Types of Threading:-
a.) User Thread :- Support above the kernel and managed w/o kernal support.
a.) Kernal Thread :- Support and managed directly by OS/kernal.

Relationship b/w User & Kernal Thread
a.)Many-to-One
b.)One-to-One
a.)Many-to-Many

Hyperthreading:- In these system's processor core's resources become multiple logical 
processors for performance. 
It allow MultiThreading
=============== 3(33) ===============
fork or exec
fork :- used to create separte,duplicate process.
exec :- the program specified in parameter of exec() will replace the entire 
    process- including all threads.
