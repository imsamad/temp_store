- Tpt Layer
    - TCP
        - Connection-oriented (Logical Connection)(3-way handshake)
        - Reliable by confirmation of delivery
        - Data is delivered in ordered
        - Flow control - adjusts maximum transmission rate
        - More overhead
        - Security identical bcz as such no mechanism is involved
        - If the acknowledgement has not reached the sender, it needs to resend that data.
    - UDP
        - Not Connection oriented
        - No confirmation of delivery it put data on wire and hope for best. Fire and Forgot
        - Data is may or may not delivered in ordered
        - Flow control - It transmit as fast as it can
        - Less Overhead
        - Security identical bcz as such no mechanism is involved
